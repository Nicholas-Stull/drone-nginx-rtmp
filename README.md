### Buy a Pi and get Noobs
I recommend a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ kit that includes power adapter, case, and micro SD card with [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) pre-installed. You can always use any old micro SD card, but search online for the proper way to format it and copy NOOBS.

### Configure the RasPi
We first need to make a few changes to the RasPi to for the purpose of optimization and personalizing it for our use.  To get started, launch Raspberry Pi Configuration which is located in the Menu under Preferences.
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rc_gui.png"><br>
This will launch the Raspberry Pi Configuration utility, a handy graphical version of the console-based raspi-config program that was used for many years to configure the RasPi (and is actually still used behind the scenes by this graphical version).  This will launch the following window:
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rcg1.png"><br>
Let‚Äôs start configuring!
* Expand Filesystem ‚Äì click this button to expand the filesystem.  This ensures that all of the SD card storage is available to Raspbian.
* (Optional) Change Password ‚Äì from a security perspective, it‚Äôs a good idea to change the default password for the ‚Äúpi‚Äù user.  Just make sure you don‚Äôt forget it. üòâ
* Hostname ‚Äì if you prefer less typing when connecting remotely (explained later), you can change the host name from ‚Äúraspberrypi‚Äù to something shorter such as ‚Äúraspi‚Äù.

### Localization
The Raspberry Pi is the brilliant brainchild from our friends in the UK.  If you are not from the UK, you will need to change some of the localization settings.  For example, some of the keys on your keyboard may not work as expected.  Here are the changes I made to make my RasPi feel at home in San Diego:

First, click on the Localisation tab:
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rcg2.png"><br>
Click the Set Locale button to change your locale as appropriate and then click OK.  Mine looks like this after making the changes:
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rcg3.png"><br>
Click the Set Timezone button to set your timezone and then click OK.
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rcg4-1.png"><br>
Click the Set Keyboard button to set your keyboard as appropriate and then click OK.  Here‚Äôs mine:
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rc_keyboard.png"><br>
Finally, click the Set WiFi Country button and change as needed.  This dialog box presents a large list of countries. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll through the list to find your country and then click OK.
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wifi-country.png"><br>
After completing these configuration steps, click OK to exit the Raspberry Pi Configuration program.  The RasPi will then let you know that it needs to reboot to activate the changes you just made.  Reboot it now.

### Configure Wi-Fi (optional)
After the RasPi reboots, we are ready to get Wi-Fi up and running to get on the network.

* Click on the network icon in the top right of the screen as shown in the screenshot. The network icon will look different than the icon in the screenshot before Wi-Fi is configured; however, it will should be located between the Bluetooth icon and the speaker (volume control) icon.
<br><img scr="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wifi.png"><br>
* After clicking the network icon, select your network SSID (Wi-Fi network).  If you don‚Äôt see your Wi-Fi network, be patient. You may see a ‚ÄúScanning APs‚Äù message in the menu; however, your Wi-Fi network SSID should eventually appear in the menu after it is located.  When your network SSID appears, click on it.
* You will be prompted for your pre shared key (Wi-Fi) network password.  Enter it and select OK.
* Wait for the icon to transform from a network icon to the Wi-Fi icon shown in the screenshot above.  From this point, you should be connected to your Wi-Fi network.
* Test your Wi-Fi network connection by launching the terminal.
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/terminal.png"><br>
* From the terminal, issue a ping command to verify your network connection is working:<br>
`$ ping google.com`

We‚Äôre now ready to move on and ensure our system is up to date with security patches.

### Apply Raspbian Updates
We will first run the apt ‚Äúupdate‚Äù command.  This command will not actually update any software on the system, but will download the latest package lists from the software repositories so that Raspbian will be aware of all new software available along with dependencies.  Issue the following command at the ‚Äú$‚Äù prompt:
<br>`$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`<br>
This is important to keep your RasPi system synchronized with security updates, etc. These two commands should be issued together and run periodically.

### Prepare Remote Desktop (optional)
We want to run our RasPi remotely without requiring a dedicated HDMI monitor and USB keyboard/mouse.  This is known as headless mode. We will be using the xrdp package to accomplish this goal. Newer versions of Raspbian (starting with versions that ship with the PIXEL desktop environment) ship with RealVNC for remote connections.  Unfortunately, RealVNC does not work well in headless mode since it degrades to a very low resolution, and there is quite a bit of ceremony required to change the resolution. The xrdp solution automatically scales our desktop resolution and makes our life much easier.  Let‚Äôs do it:
* Before we can install xrdp, we must first install the tightvncserver package.  The tightvncserver installation will also remove the RealVNC server software that ships with newer versions of Raspbian since tightvncserver (xrdp) will not work if RealVNC is installed.  (Thanks to Ryan Hanley for this tip!) Enter the following command in the terminal:
<br>`$ sudo apt install -y tightvncserver`<br>
The ‚Äú-y‚Äù option will automatically answer yes to the default questions which is what we want in this context.
* Next, invoke the following command to install xrdp:
<br>`$ sudo apt install -y xrdp`<br>
* Finally, we need to install the samba package so we will be able to access the RasPi by its host name from Windows machines on the network rather than by it‚Äôs IP address which can change since the RasPi receives its IP address via DHCP.  (For OS X users, you can install Bonjour and then access your Raspberry Pi by host name.  For example, if your host name is ‚Äúraspi‚Äù, you can access it on OS X as ‚Äúraspi.local‚Äù.)  OK, let‚Äôs install Samba:
<br>`$ sudo apt install -y samba`<br>
* After this installation completes, you should be able to ping the RasPi Hostname (configured in Raspberry Pi Configuration program above) from a Windows machine:
<br>`C:\> ping raspi`<br>
* You are now ready to launch a remote desktop connection!
* From your Windows machine, hit the Windows key, and type ‚ÄúRemote Desktop Connection‚Äù to bring up the Remote Desktop program.  Click it in to invoke it.  (OS X users can use Microsoft Remote Desktop which is available for free in the Mac App Store.)
* Type the host name of your RasPi (‚Äúraspi‚Äù in my case) in the Computer textbox.<br>
<img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rdp.png"><br>
* Next, click the Display tab. Move the Display configuration slider all the way to the right to ‚ÄúFull Screen‚Äù to ensure our remote desktop connection will fill our screen.  It may already be set to ‚ÄúFull Screen‚Äù.
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rdp2.png"><br>
* Click the Connect button near the bottom of the dialog box.
* You will then be prompted with the xrdp login screen:
<br><img src="http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/xrdpLogin.png"><br>or it might look like this:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XtaszYm.png">
* Enter your credentials and log into the RasPi.
  * username: pi
  * password: raspberry (unless you changed it in the Raspberry Pi Configuration program earlier in the tutorial.)

*[[My](https://github.com/structure7) injection: During the startup log shown after connecting to xrdp, note the port connected to (127.0.0.1 SOME_PORT), then revise /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini (probably under [xrdp1]) port to SOME_PORT (usually 5910) in lieu of -1. Now all remote connections will join the same session.]*

Amazing!  We are connected remotely to the RasPi and we no longer need the dedicated HDMI monitor and USB keyboard/mouse. Let‚Äôs go ahead and shut down the RasPi for a minute so we can free up our monitor and keyboard/mouse:

* Launch a terminal session and enter the following command to cleanly shut down your system:
<br>`$ sudo poweroff`<br>
* Wait a minute for the RasPi to fully power down.
* Unplug the power cable, HDMI cable, and the USB keyboard and mouse.
* Plug the power cable back in and the RasPi should be on its way back up without all of those extra cables!
* After giving the RasPi a minute or so to boot, connect to it once again using the Windows Remote Desktop program.
